Stockable Custom Fields For Virtuemart 3+

What is this?
---------------------

* stockablecustomfields is a plugin for creating stockable variants (child products) from custom fields assigned to the parent product.


What are the benefits of using it?
---------------------
* Uses existing custom fields (at the moment strings), to create stockable combinations.
* You can use as many custom fields as you like to create variations (e.g. Color, Size, Weight,..etc).
* Everything can be done easily from the parent product by using that plugin as custom field. You can create as many variations as you like, from that point.
* The custom field values that regard a child product, are assigned/stored to that. That means that the child products can be filtered or searched using these custom fields.
